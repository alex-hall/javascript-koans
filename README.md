Hello, and welcome Javascript Koans!

To get started, simply install the required dependencies: 

```
   yarn
```

And then run tests!

```
   yarn test
```

After that, make sure you read the failure messages carefully, and if you ever get stuck, feel free to look at the official Jest documenation
